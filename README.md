Assume the URL you had copyed is ` url_of_targer_script `

if it is a script, do the following commandï¼š

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL url_of_targer_script)"
```

if it is a configure file, download it:
```bash
curl -L url_of_targer_script -o saving_location
```

` saving_location ` is the location of the target file.
